# How it works:
A Markov chain is a mathematical model that describes a sequence of events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state of the previous event. In other words, it is a stochastic process that moves from one state to another based on a set of probabilities. The chain can be discrete-time or continuous-time, depending on whether the state changes occur at discrete or continuous intervals.<br>
**TL;DR**<br>
I used the MarkovChain to make the bot **GUESS** which word should be after another.<br>
All of the bots guesses are **Random** but **Weighted**.
